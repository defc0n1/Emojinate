# Emojinate
Emojinate is a story/blogging platform that gives you a string of 20 random emojis that you craft a story around.
It was built by [Ramsay Lanier](http://ramsaylanier.com) using [Meteor Js](http://meteor.com).

Emojinate is currently in open beta testing. [Check It Out!](http://emojinate.meteor.js).
